\section{Initial Design}

\subsection{Overview}

Our initial design called for an infrared shooting range.
The setup was to consist of multiple targets and ``guns'',
combined with a daughter board to interface them with the ZedBoard.
The ZedBoard was to run the game state machine and communicate via the daughter board
with the peripherals.
Guns would contain an IR-emitting diode used to ``fire'' a shot,
a piezo buzzer for additional user feedback,
and LEDs for indicating game state and for use in debugging.
Targets would contain IR diodes for detecting ``shots,''
as well as LEDs to indicate target state and for use in debugging.
Multiple games were to be supported,
including multiplayer ones and single-player drills.
Statistics would be collected during the game and displayed at the end of a match
along with players' scores.

\subsection{Hardware}

Three different PCBs were to be designed---one for the targets, one for the guns,
and one for the daughter board.
Each would contain a TI MSP430 microcontroller, which would be used for processing
as well as wireless communications.
The ZedBoards FPGA would be minimized andused mainly for routing,
with some switch and LED functionality for configuration.
Most (if not all) logic was to be done in software for more rapid design and debugging.

\subsection{Software}

As mentioned above, software was to handle as much logic as possible,
simplifying the hardware and FPGA designs.
Targets were to differentiate between guns by having each gun emit a unique
sequence of IR pulses, which would be resolved by the targets to a gun ID.

On the ZedBoard, the game control software was to be written in C++.
The control software would communicate with the peripherals, track game state,
and report the game results back to users.
A message protocol was developed so that game events including querying controllers,
registering shots, changing target states, and so on could be passed as message\ldots

% TODO Carry on here

To interface with players, the UI would run on a separate machine.
